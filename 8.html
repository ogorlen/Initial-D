			 Upill, the 2.0-liter turbo four had more than enough grunt to pull it up the mountain pass and it just went around corners like it was on rails. No matter how silly I was driving it didn't so much think about understeering into the guard rail.
			 Say what you will about the way it looks, the Type R is an accomplished hot hatch. The balance of the chassis and the punchiness of the engine, plus that fantastic manual gearbox, make it a very compelling package.
			 Sure, a more powerful Ford Focus RS might beat it to the top but that's not the point. I was having as much fun, if not more, than I did in the 720S on the Venus Line, and I was in a Civic
