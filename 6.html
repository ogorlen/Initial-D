			 A glance at the Honda's sat-nav map showed more hairpins than a Claire's store. At the peak of this road was another parking area, which was the starting point for the downhill stints in the anime. Staying true to the source material, I made a U-turn here and began the drive back to the start/ finish point, sorry I mean parking area, at the bottom.
			 The views werenâ€™t bad from the peak. On one side was a small glimpse at the Lake Akagi crater lake while on the other side was the spaghetti (should that be ramen noodle) of tarmac that covered the hillside. Being at a high elevation, the trees were still bare unlike the ones in Tokyo which were appropriately green considering it was late spring. Also unlike Tokyo, which was borderline unbearable, Gunma prefecture had a much more pleasant temperature.
