			 Well, it did go somewhere but it was so long and the last remaining daylight was going I didn’t end up finding out where it went. It was an incredible road though. I’m not sure if it was because it was a Friday afternoon or the time of day but there were only two other cars around. If I had more time I would’ve loved to have done a couple more laps up and down this road. It had some great straight sections and third gear corners.
