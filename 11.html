			 It turned out to be three guys visiting from Hong Kong who had rented a Civic Type R, Subaru WRX STI, and an FD RX-7 to live out their own Initial D fantasies. They were spending five days in Japan driving around in three quintessential Japanese performance cars. That's called living your best life.
			 After here they were off to the Irohazaka road so after taking a photo of the two FK8s together we went off in our separate ways. It's these sort of moments I love about visiting roads like this and the ones near Lake Miyagase. The people who come here are here because they enjoy driving.
