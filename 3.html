			The best thing about all of this was after driving on the infamous Mount Akina touge (Mount Haruna in Initial D) and Irohazaka Road, both of which had plenty of local and tourist traffic on them, the Akagi touge was surprisingly empty. It wasn't a case where I had the entire road to myself, but other cars were definitely few and far in between. Especially compared to the hoards of tourist buses on Irohazaka.
