			 There was an abandoned building on this road which made for a cool and eerie photo spot. After getting a couple of shots it was back up the road to the lake. Itâ€™s not uncommon to find lots of these small abandoned towns scattered around the countryside in Japan. During the boom of the Bubble Economy in the 1980s and early '90s, these tourist towns popped up everywhere with the promise of bringing consumption-happy visitors. Many didn't last. By the lake there were restaurants, pedal boats, and coffee shops. They were all empty. There were cars driving around but strangely no people walking around town. The only visitors here were the guys driving through for the roads. I'm sure in the winter it'd be quite a popular ski destination but in the summer they should market it as a driving destination.
