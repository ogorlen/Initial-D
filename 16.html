			 As the sun started to set I went down to the shrine by the lake for some last photos. I couldn’t have asked for a better car to explore this part of Japan. It’s only three hours from Tokyo, if the traffic isn’t hell, but it feels like a whole world away.
			 This place had it all; great roads, beautiful views, and hardly any other people around. It's not exactly the best place to break down but unless you come here in an old French car you’ll be fine. It was one of the better driving days I've had.
