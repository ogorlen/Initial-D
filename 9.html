			 A large chunk of that fun was down to going through the gears myself with a clutch pedal and gear stick on a twisty road like this. Finding the right gear for the right corner made it all the more fun and engaging. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun in a hatchback. The Type R was a truly enjoyable car to drive on these sorts of roads. The one thing it achieve was it made me want to try an older Type R even more. An older Integra or Civic Type R would be even more perfect for this road.
