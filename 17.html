			 One last surprise on the way out was a white Toyota GT86 that came out and was just blasting down the Akagi touge back. At that moment it just felt like proper Initial D. I couldn’t have asked for a better moment here.
			 If you can only visit one road from Initial D, make it this one. Sure, the Akina touge is the most well-known one, but therein lies the problem. Everyone else wants to go and drive on there. As a sightseeing experience that’s the one to do. But for sheer driving pleasure the Akagi touge has been one of my favorite roads in Japan. The Civic Type R was also the perfect car to find a road was great as this one.
