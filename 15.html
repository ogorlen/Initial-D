			 The second road I had hoped to go to was a dud. It was on Route 16 via Route 70, it appeared as even more squiggles on the Civic’s sat-nav map. But perhaps due to the weather or road works, it was closed half way up. But when life gives you lemons you make Type R lemonade. Since there was even less traffic on this road than the others, by which I mean there was no chance of any cars coming up this road because they’re smart enough to know it’s closed, I took this chance to get some pics on the road
